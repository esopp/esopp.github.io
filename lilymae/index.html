			<p><span>T</span>hink Joni Mitchell meets Laura Marling and you've got a good idea as to what Lily Mae, 19-year-old Contemporary Folk singer-songwriter, sounds like. Lily has been performing since she was four and released her debut EP, "Early Days," in 2012. The CD release concert for "Early Days" attracted over 250 people. Since then, her music has been garnering airplay internationally. She was first introduced to WXPN as their Pick of the Day and was a live guest on Gene Shay's Folk Show. Lily's list of artists she has worked with for includes: Livingston Taylor, Ben Taylor, Nathaniel Rateliff, Dry The River, Jenny Owen Youngs, The Marshall Tucker Band, Joan Osborne, and the list goes on.</p>

			<p>Lily hails from Bucks County, PA, but has quite the following in the UK. "Early Days" has been reviewed on both Folk Radio UK and For Folk's Sake. For Folk's Sake called Lily "a younger Laura Marling before she was scorned by life." Truly amazing, prodigal, and innovative are all words that have been used to describe Lily's work.</p>

			<p>Industry legend and beloved past president of Blue Note Records, Bruce Lundvall says, "Lily Mae has a signature voice, writes excellent songs, and is a future star." </p>
